## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check if the issue has already been reported. If it has and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

**Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems related to the same problem you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include copy/pasteable snippets which you use in those examples, as Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of the app the suggestion is related to.

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs in your pull request whenever possible
* Follow the JavaScript and CSS styleguides
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured tests
* Document new code
* End all files with a newline

## Styleguides
